# Goal-Setting and Self-Determination in Scrum Team Effectiveness: A Five-Factor Analysis
            

**Research Question**: How do the underlying theories of goal-setting and self-determination support the five factor theory for scrum team effectiveness?

**Expanded Question**: Given the core tenets of goal-setting theory (specificity, challenge, acceptance/commitment, feedback, and task complexity), and the core tenets of self-determination theory (three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness, along with types of motivation and the role of the social environment), how do these theories support the Five Factor Theory (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) for scrum team effectiveness?


## Key Topics
* **Goal-Setting Theory:** (including specificity, challenge, acceptance/commitment, feedback, and task complexity)
* **Self-Determination Theory:** (including autonomy, competence, relatedness, motivation types, and social environment)
* **Five Factor Theory (Big Five):** (including Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism)
* **Scrum Team Effectiveness:** (Defining what constitutes team effectiveness in this context)
* **Relationships/Connections between the theories:** (How do the principles of each theory support or interact with the others to influence scrum team effectiveness.)

## Key Concepts
### Self-Determination Theory as a Scrum Framework
        
* **Question**: How do goal-setting and self-determination influence the effectiveness of Scrum teams, considering the five-factor analysis?

* **Answer Strategies**: 
  * Examining Scrum teams as complex systems, analyzing how goal setting, self-determination, the five-factor model (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism), team dynamics, and organizational context (e.g., company culture, support from leadership) interact to influence team performance and effectiveness.
  * Breaking down the research question into smaller, more manageable components.
  * Combining insights from project management (Scrum framework), organizational psychology (goal-setting theory, self-determination theory, personality psychology - five-factor model), and potentially data science (for data analysis) to create a holistic perspective.
  * Employing an iterative research cycle, starting with a pilot study or literature review, forming initial hypotheses, collecting preliminary data, analyzing results, and refining the research question, methodologies, and hypotheses based on the findings.
  * Utilizing quantitative and qualitative data: gathering quantitative data (e.g., sprint completion rates, velocity, defect rates, survey results on team member satisfaction and personality traits), and qualitative data (e.g., interviews with team members and Scrum masters, observation of team meetings) to identify the impact of goal-setting, self-determination, and personality traits.

### Importance of Clear Objective Communication in Scrum
        
* **Question**: How does clear goal-setting and self-determination influence the five factors of scrum team effectiveness?

* **Answer Strategies**: 
  * Examining the Scrum framework as a system, focusing on how clear goal-setting and self-determination interact with the five factors of team effectiveness (e.g., trust, psychological safety, shared understanding, collaboration, and results), considering feedback loops and emergent properties.
  * Breaking down the research question into smaller, more manageable sub-questions focused on each factor of Scrum team effectiveness (e.g., How does goal-setting influence trust within a Scrum team?). Investigating the direct impact of goal-setting and self-determination on each factor individually.
  * Combining insights and methods from project management (Scrum), organizational psychology (team dynamics, motivation), and behavioral economics (goal-setting, decision-making).
  * Comparing different Scrum teams or project scenarios with varying levels of goal-setting and self-determination. For example, comparing teams with clearly defined goals and high autonomy to those with vague goals and low autonomy.
  * Collecting both qualitative and quantitative data. This would involve using surveys to measure team effectiveness factors, analyzing Scrum team performance metrics (e.g., velocity, defect rates), and conducting interviews to understand team members' perceptions of goal-setting and autonomy.
