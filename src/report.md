- **Supplements**: Often used by vegans, vegetarians, and those with deficiencies, though excessive intake can lead to toxicity (Harvard, 2019; Healthdirect, n.d.).

### IMMUNE FUNCTION
#### Immune Function Overview

##### Purpose
The primary purpose of the immune system is to protect the body from harmful substances, such as bacteria, viruses, cancer cells, and other foreign invaders (Delves, P.J., n.d.). It achieves this by distinguishing "self" from "nonself" and responding appropriately to potential threats (Delves, P.J., n.d.).

##### Key Components
- **Innate Immunity**: Immediate defense against all antigens. Includes physical barriers (skin, mucous membranes), inflammatory cells (neutrophils, macrophages), and natural killer cells (Delves, P.J., n.d.).
- **Acquired (Adaptive) Immunity**: Develops over time, providing specific responses to pathogens. Includes B cells (produce antibodies), T cells (attack infected cells), and immune memory for future encounters (Delves, P.J., n.d.; Silva, M.j. et al., 2022).

##### Important Organs and Systems
- **Bone Marrow**: Produces all types of white blood cells, both innate and adaptive (Nih, n.d.).
- **Thymus**: Where T cells mature and learn to distinguish "self" from "nonself" (Delves, P.J., n.d.).
- **Lymphoid Organs**: Include lymph nodes, spleen, and mucosal tissues, which facilitate the activation and coordination of immune responses (Nih, n.d.).

##### Process of Immune Response
1. **Recognition**: Identifying antigens or pathogens through specific sensors like PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) or DAMPs (danger-associated molecular patterns) (Nih, n.d.).
2. **Activation and Mobilization**: Activating immune cells to respond to identified threats, involving processes like phagocytosis or antibody production (Delves, P.J., n.d.).
3. **Regulation**: Ensuring the response is proportional and does not cause unnecessary damage, managed by regulatory T cells and cytokines (Delves, P.J., n.d.). 

##### Types of Immunity
- **Passive Immunity**: Temporary protection via external antibodies, such as those passed from mother to child during pregnancy (Medlineplus, n.d.).
- **Active Immunity**: Long-term protection developed through infection or vaccination (Medlineplus, n.d.).

### WOUND HEALING
#### Wound Healing Overview

##### Phases of Wound Healing

The process of wound healing is complex and involves multiple phases. It can be broadly categorized into four stages: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling.

**1. Hemostasis**
   - The first stage where bleeding stops through clotting.
   - Lasts up to two days and forms a scab that protects the wound (Almadani, Y.h. et al., 2021; Hopkinsmedicine, 2024; Leonard, C., 2020).

**2. Inflammation**
   - Involves cleaning the wound of debris and bacteria.
   - Typically lasts up to seven days in acute wounds and longer in chronic wounds (Almadani, Y.h. et al., 2021; Leonard, C., 2020).

**3. Proliferation**
   - Focuses on rebuilding tissue through granulation, angiogenesis, and epithelialization.
   - Can last from a few days to three weeks (Almadani, Y.h. et al., 2021; Leonard, C., 2020).

**4. Remodeling**
   - The final stage where new tissue is made stronger over months or years.
   - Scar tissue forms, but never reaches 100% of its original strength (Almadani, Y.h. et al., 2021; Hopkinsmedicine, 2024; Leonard, C., 2020).

##### Factors Affecting Healing

- **Blood Supply**: Reduced blood flow can lead to chronic wounds (Hopkinsmedicine, 2024).
- **Infection**: Microbial colonization can hinder or prevent healing if not properly managed (Bowler, P.g. et al., 2001).
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Nutrition, smoking status, and overall health can significantly impact healing speed and effectiveness (Bowler, P.g. et al., 2001; Hopkinsmedicine, 2024).

### DNA AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS
#### Overview of DNA and Protein Synthesis

**DNA and Protein Synthesis** involves two main processes: **transcription** and **translation**. These processes form the **central dogma of molecular biology**:

1. **DNA → RNA (Transcription)**
   - **Location:** Nucleus
   - **Process:**
     - **Initiation:** RNA polymerase binds to DNA's promoter.
     - **Elongation:** RNA polymerase synthesizes mRNA by adding nucleotides.
     - **Termination:** RNA polymerase detaches from DNA when transcription completes.
   - **Result:** mRNA is synthesized, which is complementary to the DNA template strand.

2. **RNA → Protein (Translation)**
   - **Location:** Ribosomes in the cytoplasm.
   - **Process:**
     - **Initiation:** Ribosome binds to mRNA; initiator tRNA brings the first amino acid.
     - **Elongation:** tRNAs bring amino acids to the ribosome, where they are linked into a polypeptide chain.
     - **Termination:** A stop codon signals the end of translation, and the polypeptide chain is released.

3. **Key Components:**
   - **mRNA:** Carries genetic information from DNA.
   - **tRNA:** Transfers amino acids to the ribosome.
   - **Ribosomes:** Site of protein synthesis where amino acids are linked into polypeptide chains.

#### Central Dogma Summary
- **DNA** contains genetic instructions.
- **Transcription** converts DNA instructions into mRNA.
- **Translation** converts mRNA instructions into proteins.
- **Proteins** determine the structure and function of cells.

### ENZYME FUNCTION
