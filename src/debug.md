## Goal-Setting Theory Overview

**Definition**: Goal-setting theory, developed by Edwin A. Locke and Gary P. Latham, is a motivational framework that emphasizes the importance of setting specific, challenging, yet attainable goals to enhance performance and motivation (Egbert, J. & Roe, M., n.d.; Gowland, M., 2023; Moore, C. & Neuhaus, M., 2019).

### Key Principles of Goal-Setting Theory
1. **Clarity**: Goals should be specific, well-defined, and easy to understand (Gowland, M., 2023; Moore, C. & Neuhaus, M., 2019).
2. **Challenge**: Goals must be difficult but achievable, as they motivate more than easy goals (Chowdhury, M.R. & Neuhaus, M., 2019; Moore, C. & Neuhaus, M., 2019).
3. **Commitment**: Individuals must be committed to their goals for optimal performance (Chowdhury, M.R. & Neuhaus, M., 2019; Gowland, M., 2023).
4. **Feedback**: Regular feedback is crucial for tracking progress and motivating individuals (Gowland, M., 2023; Moore, C. & Neuhaus, M., 2019).
5. **Complexity**: Goals should involve manageable tasks rather than overly complex ones (Gowland, M., 2023).

### Implementation Using SMART Goals
- **Specific**: Clearly define what you want to achieve.
- **Measurable**: Quantify your goal to track progress.
- **Achievable**: Ensure the goal is realistic and attainable.
- **Relevant**: Align the goal with broader objectives and values.
- **Time-bound**: Set deadlines for completion (Kay, J. & Day, J.H., n.d.).

### Applications
Goal-setting theory is applied in various domains, including business, education, and sports, to improve motivation, performance, and satisfaction (Egbert, J. & Roe, M., n.d.; Gowland, M., 2023).
